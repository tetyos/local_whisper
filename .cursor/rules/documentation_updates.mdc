# Documentation Update Rule

## Context
When the user provides new requirements or discusses architectural/technical changes in the chat.

## Rules
1. **New Requirements**: Any new functional or non-functional requirement mentioned by the user must be added to `requirements.md`.
   - Use the existing format (e.g., `### FR-X: Name` or `### NFR-X: Name`).
   - Keep it concise but complete.
2. **Technical Changes**: Relevant technical or architectural changes should be added to `tech.md`.
   - This includes changes to dependencies, component flow, state machine, or technical decisions.
   - Do not make it super detailed; focus on the high-level technical impact.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure that `requirements.md` and `tech.md` remain consistent with each other.
